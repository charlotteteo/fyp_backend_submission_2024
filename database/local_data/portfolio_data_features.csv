The name is derived from the 12 different funds in the portfolio spread across 7 different asset classes.  Israelsen describes the thought process of mixing asset types as similar to making salsa, where individual ingredients may seem bland or way too spicy on their own but are all critical to the success of the recipe. The 7Twelve Portfolio assets are weighted in equal proportions, and he classifies it as a “core” portfolio that should be built around rather than tweaked. For example, his age based models all equally weight the same assets where the only difference is the percentage of cash that can be increased to reduce risk for older investors.

Classic 60-40,"{'Total Stock Market': 0.6, 'Intermediate Bonds': 0.4}",The Classic 60-40 Portfolio by John Bogle is a simple and effective asset allocation that follows the stock and bond markets with only two inexpensive index funds.,"As the godfather of index investing, John Bogle spoke eloquently about the importance of avoiding market timing, diversifying your portfolio, minimizing fees, and staying the course. At a time when common investing advice involved individual stock picking, he went a different direction and not only promoted buying the entire market but also created the first index funds that made it possible for people to do so. The Classic 60-40 portfolio is his default asset allocation suggestion for pretty much every investor, and has been a staple of portfolio discussions ever since. The Classic 60-40 consists of two funds — a total stock market fund and an intermediate bond fund. The stocks are intended to drive returns, while the bonds are selected to reduce volatility and smooth out the ride. Bogle suggests that the percentage of stocks can be varied by the age of the investor, with young investors holding up to 80% and retirees holding as few as 50%. But he’s also a big fan of keeping it simple, and suggests that sticking with a 60-40 portfolio for life is really all you need.","['https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/09/18/classic-60-40-three-fund-and-the-effect-of-international-exposure/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/12/16/three-secret-ingredients-of-the-most-efficient-portfolios/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/10/27/find-what-you-need-with-improved-portfolio-profiles/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/09/20/the-right-savings-rate-will-conquer-any-bear-market/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/08/14/measure-the-expense-ratio-to-maximize-your-leaky-portfolio/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/05/04/a-big-remodel-starts-with-the-simplest-idea/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2020/05/20/how-to-prepare-for-portfolio-moving-day/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/05/27/high-profits-at-low-rates-the-benefits-of-bond-convexity/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/04/16/things-we-can-all-learn-from-the-yale-vs-buffett-debate/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/02/26/target-practice-is-a-good-way-to-measure-portfolio-accuracy/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2017/03/21/how-to-predict-withdrawal-rates-without-a-crystal-ball/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/12/09/perpetual-withdrawal-rates-are-the-runway-to-a-long-retirement/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/10/06/an-illustrated-guide-to-retirement-spending-strategies/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/02/08/coffee-stocks-and-the-importance-of-being-specific/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/01/25/how-to-build-a-portfolio-one-asset-at-a-time/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/01/04/investing-for-all-seasons/']","John Bogle was the founder of Vanguard, the creator of the first index fund, and a true pioneer of index investing.

While to some that may seem like a trendy choice destined to underperform, the data reveals a remarkable truth.

With a tight band of growth paths that are helpful for future estimates and notably high withdrawal rates that are great for retirees, it’s a particularly dependable portfolio option suitable for both accumulators and retirees alike.","['https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/04/18/the-theory-behind-the-golden-butterfly/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/09/22/catching-a-golden-butterfly/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2023/08/24/investing-supplies-for-the-financial-journey/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2023/05/08/the-striking-appeal-of-the-weird-portfolio/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2023/04/20/bonus-points-failing-early-and-often/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2023/02/10/bonus-points-life-after-the-ice/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2023/01/26/learning-the-hard-way-2022-portfolio-rankings/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/11/10/bonus-points-election-hangover-edition/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/11/05/harvesting-the-fall-why-i-sold-all-my-bonds/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/10/25/bonus-points-small-insights-that-add-up/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/10/18/the-story-of-the-portfolio-charts-hat/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/07/07/halfway-to-nowhere-2022-mid-year-portfolio-rankings/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/05/27/proven-ways-to-protect-your-portfolio-from-inflation/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/04/12/unexpected-returns-shannons-demon-the-rebalancing-bonus/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/03/01/safe-investing-in-a-time-of-uncertainty/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/12/16/three-secret-ingredients-of-the-most-efficient-portfolios/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/03/02/how-to-survive-and-make-money-in-the-matrix/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2020/08/21/metal-money-and-the-measurable-value-of-gold/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2020/06/08/welcome-to-the-big-bounce/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2020/03/23/asset-allocation-in-the-most-painful-month/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/10/07/how-to-build-a-noise-cancelling-portfolio/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/08/20/the-top-4-portfolios-to-recession-proof-your-investments/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/05/27/high-profits-at-low-rates-the-benefits-of-bond-convexity/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/02/25/every-portfolio-has-a-tradeoff-but-its-not-as-clear-cut-as-you-think/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/02/11/when-aiming-for-a-target-consider-the-accuracy-of-the-weapon/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/10/01/try-a-modern-spin-on-a-classic-idea-with-the-pinwheel-portfolio/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/09/17/welcome-to-the-central-portfolio-station/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/07/28/should-index-investors-be-worried-about-facebook/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/05/10/the-pool-of-portfolio-data-is-now-better-than-ever/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/02/26/target-practice-is-a-good-way-to-measure-portfolio-accuracy/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2017/05/12/understanding-cash-will-make-you-a-better-and-happier-investor/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2017/03/03/the-7twelve-portfolio-and-the-power-of-broad-diversification/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/12/26/the-top-portfolio-charts-posts-of-2016/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/12/09/perpetual-withdrawal-rates-are-the-runway-to-a-long-retirement/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/10/23/how-to-manage-investment-drawdowns-by-thinking-differently/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/07/25/thinking-beyond-stocks-can-fortify-your-accumulation-plan/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/06/27/wise-investors-can-learn-a-lot-from-their-emotions/']","I’m a mechanical engineer, investing researcher, spreadsheet aficionado, and the author of Portfolio Charts.

One of the most notable features of the Ideal Index portfolio is its inclusion of small cap growth stocks in the allocation.

The Larry Portfolio combines those two specialties into a single portfolio that simultaneously increases returns and reduces risk. It accomplishes those goals with very deliberate asset choices built into an intelligent risk management framework. The Larry Portfolio is discussed in Swedroe’s book Reducing The Risk of Black Swans, which is an educational treatise on how to avoid unexpected catastrophic losses. The basic idea is to mix small percentages of assets with the highest expected returns (but also the highest uncertainty) with large percentages of stable bonds to protect yourself even if the risky assets totally tank. That idea of adjusting asset percentages inversely proportional to their volatility is called “risk parity”. And the Larry Portfolio is a prime example of that sophisticated financial concept distilled into a simple portfolio that anyone can build for themselves.","['https://portfoliocharts.com/2017/02/03/black-swans-and-the-larry-portfolio/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/07/07/halfway-to-nowhere-2022-mid-year-portfolio-rankings/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/04/12/unexpected-returns-shannons-demon-the-rebalancing-bonus/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2020/12/18/portfolio-roundup-the-fastest-way-to-lose-money-in-2020/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2020/03/23/asset-allocation-in-the-most-painful-month/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/08/20/the-top-4-portfolios-to-recession-proof-your-investments/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/05/27/high-profits-at-low-rates-the-benefits-of-bond-convexity/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/11/24/averages-beverages-and-the-benefits-of-baseline-returns/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/05/10/the-pool-of-portfolio-data-is-now-better-than-ever/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2017/12/26/the-top-portfolio-charts-posts-of-2017/']",Larry Swedroe is a financial author and the Chief Research Officer at Buckingham Strategic Wealth.

By adding small cap stocks, international stocks, and short term bonds to a traditional large cap stock fund, it demonstrates how easy it is to construct a well-considered asset allocation that doesn’t depend so much on the handful of large cap companies that tend to dominate stock returns.

So he chose four assets that he saw as uniquely qualified to respond positively in each of the four economic conditions.

An advocate for free markets and free people, Harry Browne was the Libertarian presidential nominee in 1996 and 2000. He talks about the Permanent Portfolio in his book Fail-Safe Investing.","Summary of portfolio and allocations: The Permanent Portfolio, as designed by Harry Browne, is a diversified investment strategy that aims to protect and grow wealth in an unpredictable economic environment. The portfolio is equally allocated across four asset classes: Total Stock Market (25%), Long Term Bonds (25%), Cash (25%), and Gold (25%). This allocation is designed to balance economic risk across four fundamental economic conditions: prosperity, recession, inflation, and deflation.  Risk Appetite:  Given the balanced nature of the portfolio and its aim to protect wealth in all economic conditions, the risk appetite of this strategy is relatively low. On a scale of 1 to 10, it would be around 3.  Detailed Explanation of what type of investors would suit this: The Permanent Portfolio would be suitable for conservative investors who prioritize wealth preservation over high returns. These investors are likely to be risk-averse and prefer a steady growth of their investments rather than chasing high returns with higher risk. They could be nearing retirement or already in retirement, where the focus is more on income preservation and less on growth.   Additionally, this portfolio could also be suitable for investors who do not wish to frequently adjust their portfolio in response to changing economic conditions. The balanced nature of the portfolio allows it to perform reasonably well in various economic scenarios without the need for frequent rebalancing.   Finally, investors who align with Harry Browne's libertarian philosophy and his belief in free markets might also find this portfolio appealing. His approach to investing reflects his broader worldview, and investors who share these beliefs might find this portfolio to be a good fit.","The Permanent Portfolio, as designed by Harry Browne, is a diversified investment strategy that aims to protect and grow wealth in an unpredictable economic environment.

The Pinwheel Portfolio adopts each of those four assets in equal weights, and adds one complementary asset of each type to boost returns and minimize risk.  The end result is a uniquely balanced portfolio with an intelligently modern twist on a traditional 4-asset foundation. Featuring high returns and healthy withdrawal rates, it’s a good portfolio choice for both accumulators and retirees. And it’s also an easy evolution for many investors looking to add new assets to the ones they already own.","['https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/10/01/try-a-modern-spin-on-a-classic-idea-with-the-pinwheel-portfolio/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/10/18/the-story-of-the-portfolio-charts-hat/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2020/06/08/welcome-to-the-big-bounce/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/02/25/every-portfolio-has-a-tradeoff-but-its-not-as-clear-cut-as-you-think/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/01/05/a-meeting-a-book-a-portfolio-and-a-better-life/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/12/26/study-the-portfolio-rankings-to-find-an-investing-winner/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/11/24/averages-beverages-and-the-benefits-of-baseline-returns/']","I’m a mechanical engineer, investing researcher, spreadsheet aficionado, and the author of Portfolio Charts.

While Clyatt’s full Rational Investing Portfolio includes lots of assets regularly accessible only to institutional investors, he describes the Sandwich Portfolio as a simplified version suitable for everyday investors. With small cap tilts, international diversification in stocks as well as bonds, an overall balanced allocation in terms of risk, and even a practical slice of cash, the Sandwich Portfolio is a thoughtful portfolio built to last. That practical mindset is no accident. The Sandwich Portfolio is more than just an asset allocation by a stuffy economist in a tie. In fact, Clyatt left the rat race at 42 and is best known today as an award-winning artist. So his ideas are more than purely academic, and his proposed portfolio is just one component of a larger strategy with a greater purpose — to escape the work treadmill that keeps you down and empower you to pursue life on your own terms.

The original version back in 1999 actually included four funds — domestic stocks, international stocks, bonds, and cash. But as interest rates dropped over the years Larimore simplified even further, and the Three-Fund Portfolio took its final form. While the percentages cited on Portfolio Charts represent the most common default version of the portfolio, Larimore doesn’t actually see it as a fixed asset allocation. Instead, he recommends adjusting the percentage of bonds according to your age, goals, timeframe, and risk tolerance. Those factors may naturally change over time, and the Three-Fund Portfolio can change right along with them. So it’s more than just an asset allocation — it’s a portfolio meant to grow right alongside the investor for life.","['https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/09/18/classic-60-40-three-fund-and-the-effect-of-international-exposure/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/10/27/find-what-you-need-with-improved-portfolio-profiles/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/04/05/small-improvements-make-a-big-difference/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2020/05/20/how-to-prepare-for-portfolio-moving-day/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/05/27/high-profits-at-low-rates-the-benefits-of-bond-convexity/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/02/26/target-practice-is-a-good-way-to-measure-portfolio-accuracy/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2017/10/16/browse-each-portfolio-in-a-whole-new-light/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/06/27/wise-investors-can-learn-a-lot-from-their-emotions/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/10/08/withdrawal-rates-calculator-update/']","Taylor Larimore is a finance veteran, author, and long-time poster at the Bogleheads forums.

Total Stock Market,{'Total Stock Market': 1.0},The Total Stock Market Portfolio is the simplest and most cost-effective way for anyone to invest their money without overthinking it.,"In contrast to the common advice to never put all of your eggs in one basket, the Total Stock Market portfolio does just the opposite. Buy a single total market stock fund and for the most part just ignore it. It doesn’t get much simpler than that! While hardcore asset allocation fans may think that sounds way too simplistic, there’s a lot of merit to the idea that young investors are best served by spending less time on fine tuning their portfolios and more time on earning and saving. The most articulate advocate for this line of thinking today is perhaps JL Collins. Here’s what he has to say about the idea of putting everything in a total market fund and calling it a day:","['https://portfoliocharts.com/2023/01/26/learning-the-hard-way-2022-portfolio-rankings/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/12/12/the-ftx-lesson-that-all-investors-should-learn/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/11/05/harvesting-the-fall-why-i-sold-all-my-bonds/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/07/07/halfway-to-nowhere-2022-mid-year-portfolio-rankings/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/05/27/proven-ways-to-protect-your-portfolio-from-inflation/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2022/03/01/safe-investing-in-a-time-of-uncertainty/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/10/27/find-what-you-need-with-improved-portfolio-profiles/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/05/22/find-the-right-funds-to-build-a-great-portfolio/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/03/02/how-to-survive-and-make-money-in-the-matrix/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2020/12/18/portfolio-roundup-the-fastest-way-to-lose-money-in-2020/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2020/06/08/welcome-to-the-big-bounce/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2020/03/23/asset-allocation-in-the-most-painful-month/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/10/07/how-to-build-a-noise-cancelling-portfolio/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/05/07/new-approach-new-destinations/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/02/25/every-portfolio-has-a-tradeoff-but-its-not-as-clear-cut-as-you-think/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/02/11/when-aiming-for-a-target-consider-the-accuracy-of-the-weapon/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/01/05/a-meeting-a-book-a-portfolio-and-a-better-life/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/12/26/study-the-portfolio-rankings-to-find-an-investing-winner/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/11/24/averages-beverages-and-the-benefits-of-baseline-returns/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/10/01/try-a-modern-spin-on-a-classic-idea-with-the-pinwheel-portfolio/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/07/22/how-to-invest-a-windfall/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/04/16/things-we-can-all-learn-from-the-yale-vs-buffett-debate/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/02/26/target-practice-is-a-good-way-to-measure-portfolio-accuracy/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2018/02/10/financial-firewalls-defend-against-volatile-markets/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2017/06/09/your-home-country-is-inseparable-from-your-withdrawal-rate/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2017/04/29/portfolio-charts-is-going-global/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2017/04/11/tuning-stock-indices-for-a-little-more-accuracy/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/07/25/thinking-beyond-stocks-can-fortify-your-accumulation-plan/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/05/26/realistic-expectations-are-the-unsung-keys-to-success/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/05/02/a-new-tool-for-matching-goals-to-timeframes/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/03/29/the-avoidable-mistake-of-cherry-picking-data/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/03/07/the-ultimate-portfolio-guide-for-all-types-of-investors/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/02/17/a-laymans-guide-to-returns-uncertainty/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/02/08/coffee-stocks-and-the-importance-of-being-specific/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/01/25/how-to-build-a-portfolio-one-asset-at-a-time/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/01/04/investing-for-all-seasons/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/11/17/how-safe-withdrawal-rates-work/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/10/19/your-ideal-route-to-financial-independence-may-be-off-the-beaten-path/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/10/01/new-portfolio-comparison-calculator/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/09/22/catching-a-golden-butterfly/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/09/18/classic-60-40-three-fund-and-the-effect-of-international-exposure/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/09/08/why-your-safe-withdrawal-rate-is-probably-wrong/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/08/24/avoiding-the-volatility-trap/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/08/19/updated-lazy-portfolios/', 'https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/08/12/risk-in-the-real-world/']","The Total Stock Market Portfolio is really more of a benchmark than something attributable to a single author. But for a compelling explanation, read the work of JL Collins in his book The Simple Path to Wealth.","Summary of portfolio and allocations:  The Total Stock Market Portfolio is a simple, cost-effective investment strategy that involves allocating 100% of assets to a total market stock fund. This strategy is based on the idea of investing in the entire stock market, rather than trying to pick individual stocks or sectors.   Risk Appetite:  Given the 100% allocation to stocks, the risk appetite for this strategy is relatively high, around 7 out of 10. This is because stocks, while offering potentially higher returns, also come with a higher level of risk compared to other asset classes like bonds or cash.  Detailed Explanation of what type of investors would suit this:  This portfolio strategy would be most suitable for investors who are comfortable with a higher level of risk and have a long-term investment horizon. This is because the stock market can be volatile in the short term, but has historically provided positive returns over the long term.   In addition, this strategy would be ideal for investors who prefer a hands-off, passive investment approach. Since this strategy involves investing in a total market fund, it requires little to no ongoing management or decision-making on the part of the investor.   Finally, this strategy would be a good fit for investors who are looking to minimize costs. Total market funds typically have low expense ratios, which can help to maximize returns over time.   This strategy aligns well with the philosophy of JL Collins, who advocates for simplicity and a focus on earning and saving over fine-tuning investment portfolios.","The Total Stock Market Portfolio is a simple, cost-effective investment strategy that involves allocating 100% of assets to a total market stock fund.

Weird Portfolio,"{'Small Cap Value': 0.2, 'International Small Cap Blend': 0.2, 'Long Term Bonds': 0.2, 'REITs': 0.2, 'Gold': 0.2}",The Weird Portfolio by Value Stock Geek combines factor investing and risk parity concepts into an asset allocation designed to maximize returns and minimize stress.,"Value Stock Geek has an interesting and refreshingly honest approach to investing. Because he is a natural stock picker and value investor who enjoys researching individual companies, one might think that he’d not be the biggest fan of passive asset allocation. But to the contrary — the Weird Portfolio is his solution for establishing a secure investing foundation that allows him to invest in what he calls his “speculative” portfolio without worry.  True to his value investing moniker , the Weird Portfolio commits to small and value stock allocations over traditional cap-weighted funds. Beyond simply expanding into international markets, it also incorporates modern risk parity concepts with multiple volatile assets like gold, REITs, and long term treasuries to balance each other out and generate consistent returns in any economic condition.",['https://portfoliocharts.com/2023/05/08/the-striking-appeal-of-the-weird-portfolio/'],"Value Stock Geek is a DIY value investor who discusses investing in his newsletter, on his podcast, and on Twitter. He writes about his portfolio philosophy in his free online book The Weird Portfolio.","Summary of portfolio and allocations: The Weird Portfolio by Value Stock Geek is a diversified investment strategy that combines factor investing and risk parity concepts. The portfolio is allocated across five asset classes: Small Cap Value (20%), International Small Cap Blend (20%), Long Term Bonds (20%), REITs (20%), and Gold (20%). This allocation is designed to maximize returns and minimize stress, providing a balanced exposure to different market sectors and asset types.  Risk Appetite:  Given the diversified nature of the portfolio and the inclusion of traditionally safer assets like long-term bonds and gold, the risk appetite of this strategy is moderately high, around 7 out of 10. The portfolio does include riskier assets like small cap stocks and REITs, but these are balanced out by the safer assets and the overall diversification of the portfolio.  Detailed Explanation of what type of investors would suit this: The Weird Portfolio would be suitable for investors who are looking for a balanced and diversified investment strategy that aims to deliver consistent returns in any economic condition. These investors may have a moderate to high risk tolerance, as the portfolio includes both riskier and safer assets. They may also be interested in factor investing and risk parity concepts, and are comfortable with a certain level of complexity in their investment strategy.   This portfolio could also be suitable for investors who want to have a secure investing foundation that allows them to invest in other, more speculative portfolios without worry. These investors may be DIY investors who enjoy researching individual companies and picking stocks, but also want to have a portion of their investments in a more passive and diversified portfolio.   Finally, this portfolio could be a good fit for investors who are interested in value investing and small cap stocks, as these are key components of the portfolio's strategy. These investors may believe in the long-term potential of small and undervalued companies, and are willing to invest in these companies despite the higher risk and volatility compared to larger, more established companies.","The Weird Portfolio by Value Stock Geek is a diversified investment strategy that combines factor investing and risk parity concepts.
