      "If there is over-exposure, I will evaluate the risk factors. This can be done using the `technical_analysis` function. This function will provide insights into the volatility, historical performance, and correlation of the stocks in the portfolio.\n",

      "If the analysis reveals a downward trend for the overexposed sector or constituents, my suggestion would be to consider removing those constituents from the portfolio.\n",

      "On the other hand, if the portfolio is well-diversified, I would explore untapped sectors that show promise. I can use the `tavily_search_results_json` or `google_finance` functions to gather the latest news and trends about various sectors. This should help identify potential sectors for investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I have a list of potential constituents or sectors, I would conduct a comprehensive analysis of each. The `fundamental_analysis` function will provide insights into the company's fundamentals, and the `technical_analysis` function will provide technical indicators.\n",
